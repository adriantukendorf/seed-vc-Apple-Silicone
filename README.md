# Seed-VC ONLY Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) 

Currently released model supports *zero-shot voice conversion* üîä , *zero-shot real-time voice conversion* üó£Ô∏è and *zero-shot singing voice conversion* üé∂. Without any training, it is able to clone a voice given a reference speech of 1~30 seconds.  

We support further fine-tuning on custom data to increase performance on specific speaker/speakers, with extremely low data requirement **(minimum 1 utterance per speaker)** and extremely fast training speed **(minimum 100 steps, 2 min on T4)**!

**Real-time voice conversion** is support, with algorithm delay of ~300ms and device side delay of ~100ms, suitable for online meetings, gaming and live streaming.

Checkpoints of the latest model release will be downloaded automatically when first run inference.  
If you are unable to access huggingface for network reason, try using mirror by adding `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` before every command.

Command line inference:
```bash
python inference.py --source <source-wav>

## TrainingüèãÔ∏è
Fine-tuning on custom data allow the model to clone someone's voice more accurately. It will largely improve speaker similarity on particular speakers, but may slightly increase WER.  
A Colab Tutorial is here for you to follow: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R1BJTqMsTXZzYAVx3j1BiemFXog9pbQG?usp=sharing)
1. Prepare your own dataset. It has to satisfy the following:
    - File structure does not matter
    - Each audio file should range from 1 to 30 seconds, otherwise will be ignored
    - All audio files should be in on of the following formats: `.wav` `.flac` `.mp3` `.m4a` `.opus` `.ogg`
    - Speaker label is not required, but make sure that each speaker has at least 1 utterance
    - Of course, the more data you have, the better the model will perform
    - Training data should be as clean as possible, BGM or noise is not desired
2. Choose a model configuration file from `configs/presets/` for fine-tuning, or create your own to train from scratch.
    - For fine-tuning, it should be one of the following:
        - `./configs/presets/config_dit_mel_seed_uvit_xlsr_tiny.yml` for real-time voice conversion
        - `./configs/presets/config_dit_mel_seed_uvit_whisper_small_wavenet.yml` for offline voice conversion
        - `./configs/presets/config_dit_mel_seed_uvit_whisper_base_f0_44k.yml` for singing voice conversion
3. Run the following command to start training:
```bash
python train.py 
--config <path-to-config> 
--dataset-dir <path-to-data>
--run-name <run-name>
--batch-size 2
--max-steps 1000
--max-epochs 1000
--save-every 500
--num-workers 0
```
where:
- `config` is the path to the model config, choose one of the above for fine-tuning or create your own for training from scratch
- `dataset-dir` is the path to the dataset directory, which should be a folder containing all the audio files
- `run-name` is the name of the run, which will be used to save the model checkpoints and logs
- `batch-size` is the batch size for training, choose depends on your GPU memory.
- `max-steps` is the maximum number of steps to train, choose depends on your dataset size and training time
- `max-epochs` is the maximum number of epochs to train, choose depends on your dataset size and training time
- `save-every` is the number of steps to save the model checkpoint
- `num-workers` is the number of workers for data loading, set to 0 for Windows    

4. If training accidentially stops, you can resume training by running the same command again, the training will continue from the last checkpoint. (Make sure `run-name` and `config` arguments are the same so that latest checkpoint can be found)

5. After training, you can use the trained model for inference by specifying the path to the checkpoint and config file.
    - They should be under `./runs/<run-name>/`, with the checkpoint named `ft_model.pth` and config file with the same name as the training config file.
    - You still have to specify a reference audio file of the speaker you'd like to use during inference, similar to zero-shot usage.
